      <p>▶There are many kinds of crave worthy foods. From foods that are sweet and salty to savory, there is one
        crave-able item that sure gets consumers talking. National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a contractor to the
        Beef Checkoff, recently conducted research on consumer preferences for burgers when dining out. Consumers’ own
        words highlight just how enticing burgers are for them.

        Many consumers enjoy a beef burger whenever they get a chance, and many of us have our go-to places for one.
        However, the results show that quick-service establishments aren’t the only places consumers go for a burger. In
        fact, many also choose casual or even fine-dining establishments to enjoy a burger.

        More specifically, the research looked at the quality indicators for burgers and how consumers go about
        customizing and selecting their burgers when dining out. The research was conducted among 700 consumers who eat
        beef burgers. Not surprisingly, the most important aspect of a burger is its taste—after all, that is why most
        of us enjoy them so much. In addition to taste, the overall quality and the value you get for the price you pay
        is important, as some consumers note:</p>
      <h3>"The quality of beef and price are most important."

        " Value. Price vs what I'm getting."</h3>
