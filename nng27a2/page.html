               A food street is a pedestrianised area that has been designated for restaurants and cafes. Such areas are
               found in several major cities. The food street is lined with food stalls, restaurants, and other food
               shops, and are typically pedestrianized.

               Cheap/Inexpensive
               -The biggest reason that we all loves to eat street food is that it's way more economical or cheap than
               the food of Restaurants/Hotels. Street Food is very economical for the middle-class people and that's why
               the major chunk of that class prefers street food the most.

         <p> The roots of street food can take us way back into history. It is believed that as the first distribution
            point of street food, small fried fish were sold on the streets in ancient Greece. Street food was widely
            consumed by poor urban residents of ancient Rome whose tenement homes did not have ovens or hearths. In
            ancient China, where street foods generally catered to the poor, wealthy residents would send servants to
            buy street foods and bring meals back for their masters to eat in their homes. Urbanisation and street food
            go hand in hand. Historically, in places such as ancient Rome, street food was purchased because urban poor
            did not have kitchens in their homes. Across the globe, street food, sometimes also synonymous with fast
            food, has become an important part of daily life as local population increasingly struggle to keep pace with
            their hectic lifestyles. The street vendors offer hotfresh, lip smacking snacks which are very filling and
            absolute value for money.</p>
